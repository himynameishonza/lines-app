    "title": "What is the Book of Changes?",
    "body": "The Book of Changes, also known as the I Ching, is an ancient Chinese system of symbols.\n\nIt works with 64 hexagrams that describe different forms of change and development within a situation.\n\nIt does not predict what will happen. It helps you see the situation more clearly.\n\nIt is not an esoteric device, but a psychological tool for reflection."
  },

  "hexagram": {
    "title": "What is a hexagram?",
    "body": "A hexagram is a figure composed of six lines. Each line is either broken (yin) or unbroken (yang).\n\nA hexagram consists of a lower and an upper trigram (three lines each).\n\nHexagrams are read from the bottom upward."

    "step3": "Read the interpretation as a prompt for reflection, not as a fixed conclusion."

  "changingLines": {
    "title": "Changing lines",
    "body": "Sometimes a changing line appears during generation. It marks a point where the situation is developing.\n\nIn such cases, a second hexagram is generated, symbolizing the potential direction of change."
